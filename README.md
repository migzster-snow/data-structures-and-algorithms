# Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in **Java**, with emphasis on clarity, correctness, and learning.

## Motivation

I created this repository to:

* Practice implementing core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc.) and algorithms (search, sort, etc.).
* Build a reference library for myself and others who want to understand how these work under the hood.
* Improve algorithmic thinking and Java coding skills.

## Contents

As of now, this repo includes:

* **Array** operations
* **LinkedList** implementations
* **Stack** data structure
* **Search** algorithms
* **Sort** algorithms

More will be added over time (trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local copy for development and learning:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/migzster-snow/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Open in your favorite IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode).

3. Make sure you're using a recent JDK (Java 8+ recommended).

4. Run the individual Java classes (they contain `main` or test methods) to try out the code.

## Usage

* To see how a particular algorithm or data structure works, navigate to its folder (e.g. `Sort`, `Search`, `LinkedList`) and run the relevant class.
* You can also use these as a base to experiment: modify, extend, or optimize implementations.
* Feel free to benchmark or compare different methods (e.g. different sorting algorithms) within this repo.

## Structure

```
data-structures-and-algorithms/
├── Array/            ← array‐based utilities & implementations
├── LinkedList/       ← singly / doubly linked list implementations
├── Stack/            ← stack (LIFO) data structure
├── Search/           ← search algorithms (linear, binary, etc.)
├── Sort/             ← sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick, etc.)
└── README.md         ← this file
```

Each folder contains one or more Java classes relevant to that topic.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to:

* Add new data structures or algorithms
* Improve performance or readability of existing code
* Add unit tests, docs, or examples

Then please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make changes, test them
4. Submit a pull request describing what you’ve added or changed
